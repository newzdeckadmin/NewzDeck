## Download

The current stable release is **NewzDeck v3.6.69** for 64-bit Windows.

**Recommended:** download `NewzDeck_v3.6.69_Setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/newzdeckadmin/NewzDeck/releases/latest).

A Portable ZIP is also available if you prefer to run NewzDeck without a normal installation.

NewzDeck is free and open source. **Usenet access is not included** - you need your own Usenet provider account. Automation and interactive NZB search can also use your own Newznab-compatible indexer.

## What NewzDeck does

- **Browse newsgroups visually** with gallery and list views, image/video previews, grouping, tabs, bookmarks, filtering, and search.
- **Download at high speed** through the bundled private SABnzbd engine with queue controls, retries, provider-aware transfers, PAR2 verification/repair, unpacking, and post-processing.
- **See downloads live** with near-real-time transfer state, stable Active cards, and live Verify, Repair, Unpack, and Smart Import progress.
- **Discover movies and TV** with TMDB-powered posters, backdrops, metadata, cast/crew, trending titles, new releases, recommendations, filtering, and responsive title details.
- **Automate TV and movies** with monitored libraries, quality profiles, Wanted items, calendar, history, root folders, and Newznab-compatible indexers.
- **Organize media** with Smart Import, including completed downloads and explicit external TV season/episode imports, canonical renaming/moving, duplicate/existing-media handling, and safe quality upgrades.
- **Keep downloads running in the background** with the Windows background service and system tray companion.

## v3.6.69 highlights

v3.6.69 is a focused Windows settings reliability release based on repeated production `settings.json` replace failures.

- **Transient replace recovery:** settings saves retry WinError 5/32/33 contention for up to three seconds instead of failing immediately.
- **Atomic semantics preserved:** NewzDeck still writes a unique temporary file first and replaces the existing settings file only after the new content is complete.
- **Passive reliability telemetry:** Diagnostics expose settings-save attempts, retries, recovered saves, terminal failures and last WinError without exposing settings values.
- **Browsing tuning frozen:** schema 7, the accepted All Posts accumulator, Video six-slot ceiling, Image five-request gate, provider allocation, Metadata Server v0.3.3, private SABnzbd 5.1.2, Discover, Smart Import and Automation remain unchanged.

See [the full v3.6.69 release notes](release/RELEASE_NOTES_v3.6.69.md).
## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11, 64-bit
- A Usenet provider account with NNTP server credentials
- Internet access for provider connections and online metadata
- Optional: a Newznab-compatible indexer for Automation and interactive NZB search

## Getting started

1. Download and run the latest **Setup.exe**.
2. Start NewzDeck.
3. Open **Settings** and add your Usenet provider details.
4. Browse or search newsgroups and start downloading.
5. If you want TV/movie automation, add your media root folders and configure a compatible indexer.

Your NewzDeck settings, history, queue state, provider configuration, and other persistent data are stored separately from the program files under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NewzDeck`, so normal application updates preserve your data.

## Windows SmartScreen

NewzDeck is currently distributed **unsigned**, so Windows may show an **Unknown Publisher** or Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warning.

Only download NewzDeck from this repository or the official website. The release includes `NewzDeck_v3.6.69_SHA256.txt` so you can verify the installer and Portable ZIP before running them.

## Updating

Installed users should normally install the newest Setup.exe over their existing installation or use NewzDeck's verified update flow when offered.

Portable users should close NewzDeck before replacing the application files. See [UPDATING.txt](UPDATING.txt) for the short update guide.

## Troubleshooting and support

If something is not working, check NewzDeck's in-app status and diagnostic information first. When reporting a problem, include the NewzDeck version, what you were doing, what you expected to happen, and any relevant error message or screenshot.

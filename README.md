## Download

The current stable release is **NewzDeck v3.6.22** for 64-bit Windows.

**Recommended:** download `NewzDeck_v3.6.22_Setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/newzdeckadmin/NewzDeck/releases/latest).

A Portable ZIP is also available if you prefer to run NewzDeck without a normal installation.

NewzDeck is free and open source. **Usenet access is not included** — you need your own Usenet provider account. Automation and interactive NZB search can also use your own Newznab-compatible indexer.

## What NewzDeck does

- **Browse newsgroups visually** with gallery and list views, image/video previews, grouping, tabs, bookmarks, filtering, and search.
- **Download at high speed** through the bundled private SABnzbd engine with queue controls, retries, provider-aware transfers, PAR2 verification/repair, unpacking, and post-processing.
- **See downloads live** with near-real-time transfer state, stable Active cards, and live Verify, Repair, Unpack, and Smart Import progress.
- **Discover movies and TV** with TMDB-powered posters, backdrops, metadata, cast/crew, trending titles, new releases, recommendations, filtering, and responsive title details.
- **Automate TV and movies** with monitored libraries, quality profiles, Wanted items, calendar, history, root folders, and Newznab-compatible indexers.
- **Organize completed media** with Smart Import, including identification, renaming, moving, duplicate/existing-media handling, and cleanup of completed download folders.
- **Keep downloads running in the background** with the Windows background service and system tray companion.

## v3.6.22 highlights

v3.6.22 promotes the accepted All Posts binary-resolution and obfuscated-name recovery work built on v3.6.21.

- **Download complete binaries even before a friendly name is known.** Complete reconstructed multipart items remain actionable while NewzDeck performs bounded filename probes.
- **Automatic full name-resolution pass.** Loaded unresolved items are processed in safe batches without requiring repeated Resolve names clicks.
- **Honest resolution states.** NewzDeck distinguishes resolved filenames, opaque yEnc names, genuinely missing names, unavailable articles, and retryable provider failures.
- **Provider-aware retry/backoff.** Temporary NNTP failures pause and retry instead of falsely turning everything after a cutoff into NAME UNAVAILABLE.
- **Reliable long reconstruction.** Package reconstruction polling continues with backoff until it completes or the browse session changes.
- **Flat loose-binary downloads.** Individual Newsgroup binaries finish directly in the configured Download Folder root rather than a filename-named subfolder.
- **Conservative obfuscated-name recovery.** Exact PAR2 FileDesc size + full-MD5 matches can restore a protected filename; archive member names remain hints rather than speculative renames.
- **Preserved image browsing.** v3.6.21 Related Media, Continuous browsing, direct loose-image placement, cover scheduling, and long-session performance work remain intact.

See [the full v3.6.22 release notes](release/RELEASE_NOTES_v3.6.22.md).

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11, 64-bit
- A Usenet provider account with NNTP server credentials
- Internet access for provider connections and online metadata
- Optional: a Newznab-compatible indexer for Automation and interactive NZB search

## Getting started

1. Download and run the latest **Setup.exe**.
2. Start NewzDeck.
3. Open **Settings** and add your Usenet provider details.
4. Browse or search newsgroups and start downloading.
5. If you want TV/movie automation, add your media root folders and configure a compatible indexer.

Your NewzDeck settings, history, queue state, provider configuration, and other persistent data are stored separately from the program files under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NewzDeck`, so normal application updates preserve your data.

## Windows SmartScreen

NewzDeck is currently distributed **unsigned**, so Windows may show an **Unknown Publisher** or Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warning.

Only download NewzDeck from this repository or the official website. The release includes `NewzDeck_v3.6.22_SHA256.txt` so you can verify the installer and Portable ZIP before running them.

## Updating

Installed users should normally install the newest Setup.exe over their existing installation or use NewzDeck's verified update flow when offered.

Portable users should close NewzDeck before replacing the application files. See [UPDATING.txt](UPDATING.txt) for the short update guide.

## Troubleshooting and support

If something is not working, check NewzDeck's in-app status and diagnostic information first. When reporting a problem, include the NewzDeck version, what you were doing, what you expected to happen, and any relevant error message or screenshot.
